# After Thought

## Description 
After Thought is a personalzied notes app, where you can record all types of notes in any category you'd like. You can login and access these notes anywhere from any device. Are you tired of forgetting the grocery list, what you needed to get done today, or that movie your co-worker recomended? Maybe you had a great song idea, or a poem sounded nice in your head. After thought is the place to organize your thoughts and never let the important ones slip away.
